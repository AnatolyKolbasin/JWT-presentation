            JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair
            <br>
            Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.

          <h3>Use Cases</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Authorization</li>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Information Exchange</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            Here are some scenarios where these tokens are useful
            <br>
            <strong>Authorization</strong>: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.
            <br>
            <strong>Information Exchange</strong>: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

          <h3>What is the JSON Web Token structure?</h3>
          <img src="./img/json-web-token-structure.png" alt="jwt diagram structure">
          <aside class="notes">
              Let’s look at JSON Web Token structure
              <br>
              It consist of three parts separated by dots (.)              
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <section>
            <h3>Header</h3>
            <pre><code data-sample='js/header.examples.js'></code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used to create the JWT signature component. In our example, we’re using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Payload</h3>
            <pre><code data-sample='js/payload.examples.js'></code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity and additional data
              <br>
              You can put as many claims as you like. There are several different standard claims for the JWT payload, such as “iss” the issuer, “sub” the subject, and “exp” the expiration time. These fields can be useful when creating JWT, but they are optional.                
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>RFC 7519 defines the following reserved claim names:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="color:dodgerblue">iss</span> for issuer.</li>
              <li><span style="color:dodgerblue">sub</span> for a subject identifier.</li>
              <li><span style="color:dodgerblue">aud</span> for audience.</li>
              <li><span style="color:dodgerblue">exp</span> for expiration time.</li>
              <li><span style="color:dodgerblue">nbf</span> for when the token is valid from.</li>
              <li><span style="color:dodgerblue">iat</span> for when the token was issued.</li>
              <li><span style="color:dodgerblue">jti</span> for a unique token id.</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              Keep in mind that the size of the data will affect the overall size of the JWT, this generally isn’t an issue but having excessively large JWT may negatively affect performance and cause latency.
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Signature</h3>
            <pre><code data-sample='js/signature.examples.js'></code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
              <br>
              The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.

            And here are all the claims.

          <h3>How do JSON Web Tokens work?</h3>
          <img src="./img/jwt_workflow.png" alt="jwt workflow description">
          <aside class="notes">
            To show how and why JWT are actually used, we will use a simple 3 entity example. The entities in this example are the user, the application server, and the authentication server. The authentication server will provide the JWT to the user. With the JWT, the user can then safely communicate with the application.
            <br>
            In this example, the user first signs into the authentication server using the authentication server’s login system (e.g. username and password, Facebook login, Google login, etc). The authentication server then creates the JWT and sends it to the user. When the user makes API calls to the application, the user passes the JWT along with the API call. In this setup, the application server would be configured to verify that the incoming JWT are created by the authentication server .So, when the user makes API calls with the attached JWT, the application can use the JWT to verify that the API call is coming from an authenticated user.

        <section>
          <h3>Where are JWT tokens stored?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Don't store it in local storage (or session storage)</li>
            <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">The JWT needs to be stored inside an HttpOnly cookie</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            A JWT needs to be stored in a safe place inside the user's browser.<br>
            If you store it inside localStorage, it's accessible by any script inside your page (which is as bad as it sounds as an XSS attack can let an external attacker get access to the token).
            Don't store it in local storage (or session storage). If any of the 3rd part scripts you include in your page gets compromised, it can access all your users' tokens.
            The JWT needs to be stored inside an HttpOnly cookie, a special kind of cookie that's only sent in HTTP requests to the server, and it's never accessible (both for reading or writing) from JavaScript running in the browser.

          <h3>Thanks for watching</h3>
          <h2>Questions?</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            So, it was a quik review of JSON Web Token. In conclusion I can say that JWT is a very popular standard you can use to trust requests by using signatures, and exchange information between parties. Make sure you know when it's best used, when it's best to use something else, and how to prevent the most basic security issues.
